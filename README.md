# ChatApp

Developed a full-stack real-time chat application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Integrated Socket.io for real-time messaging between users. Implemented user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and secured password storage with bcrypt. The backend was connected to MongoDB Atlas for scalable and reliable database storage. Managed RESTful APIs for chat and user-related functionalities. Used nodemon for development monitoring and resolved database connection issues with MongoDB Atlas and whitelisting. The application also supports multiple rooms and user presence indication.
